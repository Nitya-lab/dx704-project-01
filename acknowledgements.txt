I acknowledge the use of the following libraries and resources:

- pandas, numpy, matplotlib — data manipulation and plotting
- yfinance — downloading market data
- scipy.optimize — portfolio optimization

I discussed this assignment with no one and did not use any additional sources beyond the course materials,
other than occasional Google searches to help understand concepts covered in class.
